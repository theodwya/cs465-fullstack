CS-465 Full Stack Development with Mean

## Architecture

### Frontend Development

- **Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**

  I used a combination of frontend technologies in my full stack project:

   - **Express**: This was utilized as our backend framework to handle routing, middleware, and server operations efficiently. Express allowed us to create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

   - **HTML**: HTML was used for structuring the web pages, providing the foundation for creating the layout and content of our application.

   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript played a crucial role in adding interactivity to our frontend. It was used to handle user events, perform client-side validations, and update the DOM dynamically.

   - **Single Page Application (SPA)**: We adopted the SPA approach to reduce page reloads, enhancing the user experience by loading content dynamically and improving overall performance.

### Backend Development and MongoDB

- **Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

  I used a NoSQL MongoDB database for the following reasons:

   - **Flexibility**: MongoDB's document-based structure provided flexibility in data storage, allowing us to adapt to changing requirements.

   - **Scalability**: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities made it suitable for handling increasing data volumes as our application grew.

   - **Speed**: MongoDB efficiently handled large amounts of unstructured data, which was advantageous for managing various data types like user profiles and product information.

## Functionality

- **How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**

   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is a structured data format, whereas JavaScript is used for programming logic. JSON serves as a common language for communication between frontend and backend by representing data in a format easily parsed and generated by various programming languages.

- **Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

   Throughout the development process, we refactored our code to enhance functionality and efficiency. Benefits of reusable UI components included:

   - **Modularity**: Breaking down code into reusable components improved maintainability and extensibility.

   - **Efficiency**: Reduced code duplication and ensured consistency, making development more efficient.

## Testing

- **Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

   In a full stack application:

   - **Methods**: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used for requests and retrieval, each serving a specific purpose in creating, reading, updating, or deleting data.

   - **Endpoints**: Endpoints are URLs through which frontend and backend communicate. Proper definition and documentation of endpoints are crucial for clear communication.

   - **Security**: Security features such as authentication and authorization are essential to ensure only authorized users access specific endpoints and protect sensitive data.

## Reflection

- **How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

   This course has been instrumental in my professional growth:
